# async-firmata

## An asynchronous interface for the Firmata protocol

The releases are currently a total mess so in the next weeks I'm planning to remake this library from scratch with everything I've learned from this project

## Installation

You can currently install the latest version for Python >= 3.6 with
```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/lennart-k/python-async-firmata
```
